# alienrpg-zombie-yearzerolite
A collection of tables &amp; macros for use with the Alien RPG system module, as seen on the solo Actual Play on 3 Skulls Tavern (https://3skulls.tv).

## REQUIREMENTS
"Alien RPG" system module
"Game-Icons.net" add-on module

## TO INSTALL
1. Go to Manage Modules and activate the Game-Icons.net and Kentucky Zombie Apocalypse modules.
2. Go to the Compendiums tab, right-click on each of the 5 compendiums added with this module and then choose "Import All Content", keeping the default folder.
3. Before some macros will work, you will need to populate some of the RollTables with content. Go to the RollTables tab, find the new "Zombie Tables" folder, and look for the RollTables which begin with "CHANGE". These are not currently populated due to copyright.
4. In the description of each of these modules, you will see which tables I populated them with for my YouTube campaign. If you have these games yourself (Ironsworn is free), then you can populate these tables with your own entries. Use the little + icon to the left of "Result Type" to add new fields.
5. Alternatively, use the excellent "Easy Table by Blitz" module to quickly create tables. If you create new tables, they will need the same names as the ones you're replacing (and there can be no duplicates), otherwise the macros won't work.
6. Once finishing populating a table, be sure to update the "Roll Table Formula" field so that it reads "1dX" where "X" represents the range (i.e. number of entries).
